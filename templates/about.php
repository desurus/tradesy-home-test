        <h1>Our Story</h1>
    </div>
    <p>One day, years ago, Tradesy founder Tracy DiNunzio stared into the messy expanse of her closet, and realized that it was full of things she never used. She saw a once-worn wedding dress, beautiful shoes that pinched her feet, and pants that no longer fit. Suddenly, she was compelled to simplify her life. Surely, there was someone who would treasure the things she no longer wanted, but how could she find them? Where could she easily and safely sell her things to other like-minded women?</p>
    <p>Tracy set out to connect women’s closets. She worked tirelessly at her kitchen table, slept on the couch and rented her bedroom on AirBnB to finance early development. On October 24th, 2012, with a newly-formed team of just seven people, Tradesy officially launched.</p>
    <p>Today, Tradesy serves millions of the world’s coolest customers, has secured backing from iconic investors like Richard Branson and John Doerr, and has been covered by Good Morning America, The Today Show, The New York Times, TIME, USA Today, and more. We’re well on our way to changing the way people buy and sell fashion, but really, we’re just getting started.</p>
